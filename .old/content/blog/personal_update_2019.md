Despite actually writing several posts, but never getting them finished and actually posted, this blog is not dead. Titles of some of the posts that I need to circle back and finish include:

* Your BETA isn’t BETA - The (good) abuse of BETA and Early Access
* Gestalt Cues for Programmers - A primer on Gestalt Cues
* An introduction to Particle Filters and SLAM
* Reinventing the wheel - How hype drives us to repeat mistakes
* My Top 10 Games of All Time

Some of these, such as “Reinventing the wheel” are actually almost 100% finished, but need a couple more passes and perhaps some better citations. Generally, unless it’s video game related, I tried to cite everything and be as factual as possible when writing. I hope to finish one or two of these sometime soon.

What’s kept me so busy then is I am now back and doing mobile & graphics development once again. Web development definitely pays the bills, but it’s lost it’s luster. My current position has me doing working on AR experiences on Android, and I’m enjoying it immensely. It’s in the commerce sector which I’m still new too; AR for commerce is definitely a lot different than VR for journalism, but XR is XR.

Interestingly, this position has also found me involved with the 3DFormats and 3DCommerce working groups from the Khronos Group. This week I find myself at SIGGRAPH meeting some of the great people involved with these working groups and others. I won’t lie, some of this is pretty _intimidating_. All of these people are extremely smart and well minded, and despite consciously knowing I can help and learn, the concept of working with Khronos is kind of surreal still.

Outside of work, my wife and I have had several small trips, and we’ve been working on the house some, which has kept me away from personal projects some. One that I’ve recently embarked on is writing a small Vulkan based game engine, just to do it. I’ve also started, then tabled, a single-player pong game called “Hexapong” using Unreal Engine 4. I hope to pick it back up later, but it got to the point where both the game itself and the development of the game were not fun.

A todo that I am hoping to get done soon is better streamlining the process of writing, editing, and publishing new blog posts. This includes getting a better build process going using the GitLab CI stuff to build and deploy when I check in an update. I hope to have that done sometime late this week or early next.
