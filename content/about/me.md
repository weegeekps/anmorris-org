title: "About Me"
---

If you're here, you probably are interested who I am and what I do. I'm Adam Morris, a Software Engineer located in the
Midwestern United States. If you dig around you can probably figure out who I work for, but I generally don't care to
share that info. I grew up in Georgia, attended [Georgia College & State University](http://www.gcsu.edu/) in 
[Milledgeville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milledgeville,_Georgia) for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, and
I attended [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) several years later for a Master's Degree in Human-Computer
Interaction. At ISU, I gained a background in Virtual Environments (including Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality) and
deeply studied Visually Induced Motion Sickness and Presence, two topics that I still actively study on my own today.

I've been a computer nerd since I was a kid. The first computer I spent any length of time on (mostly to play a Space
Invaders clone) was my parents' [Kaypro II](http://oldcomputers.net/kayproii.html). At school I often would try to fiddle
with the [Apple IIe](http://oldcomputers.net/appleii.html) computers as often as I was allowed. Some of the coolest 
computers I ever got my hands on as a kid included the [Amiga 500](http://oldcomputers.net/amiga500.html) and our first
386 with a Sound Blaster.

My first attempt at really trying to learn programming was on our first 386 with QBASIC in the early 90s. Over time I 
figured it out and learned Pascal and eventually C++ on my own during High School. In High School, I started to play 
around with modding video games and creating websites. This led me ultimately to becoming a Web Developer for many years 
and even today a predominant amount of software I write is for the web.

Professionally, I currently write web software, but I've written software for desktops and mobile phones including Virtual
Reality applications. Personally, I almost always have [several projects currently in flight.](/projects). Typcially, my
personal projects are started due to me wanting to learn a new technology, solve a problem that I have or just want to
solve, or just because I think it'll be fun. Additionally, I try to contribute to Free and Open Source Software projects 
when I am able.
