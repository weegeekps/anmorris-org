title: "About this Site"

The original goals for this site have been threefold:

1. It needs to be simple to maintain and stay out of my way.
2. It needs to have a basic, minimal design.
3. It needs to be extensible.

My first attempt in 2018 didn't quite get me where I wanted, and I recently just rewrote the site. I've written two blog posts that you can read to learn more about my thought process behind the site's design and construction:

- [The Perfect Blog, Attempt #2]({{<ref "/blog/the_perfect_blog">}})
- [About this site]({{<ref "/blog/about_this_site_2018">}}), the original post. How na√Øve I was...

If you want to keep up with the latest updates on the site, check out the [site updates tag]({{<ref "/tags/site-updates">}}). There you should be able to find the latest updates. I will generally attempt to include updates regarding new features and how I implemented them for other users of Hugo.
