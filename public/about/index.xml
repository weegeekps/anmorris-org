      <description>Every project we work on tends to be a learning experience. Sometimes we learn new technologies, sometimes we learn things about ourselves, and sometimes we learn life lessons. This project that led to the creation of this website fit into the life lessons category.
It&amp;rsquo;s taken 3 years, working on and off, for this simple website to take shape. If that sounds insane, you&amp;rsquo;re absolutely right, it is. In actuality, this is probably the 4th or 5th iteration of the site.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re here, you probably are interested who I am and what I do. I&amp;rsquo;m Adam Morris, a Software Engineer located in the Midwestern United States. If you dig around you can probably figure out who I work for, but I generally don&amp;rsquo;t care to share that info. I grew up in Georgia, attended Georgia College &amp;amp; State University in Milledgeville for my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Computer Science, and I attended Iowa State University several years later for a Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Human-Computer Interaction.</description>
